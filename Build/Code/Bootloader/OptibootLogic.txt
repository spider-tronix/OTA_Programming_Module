Notes:
 The virtual boot partition is a feature needed for those models like the  attiny1634,
which doesn't support a separate boot section, meaning that you'd have to use optiboot's "virtual boot partition support".

What this does is, first it stores the appplication start vector into any unused vector and goes to that vector location
and write the address of the start of the optiboot code, so once it reset the optiboot vode is run first and if it decides
to go to run the application it will fetch the address at unused vector which was stored initially,and the the application code is run.


However, the Atmega328P has a dedicated NRWW section where the bootloader size can be varied of our choice.



# Different baud rates are selected, also the error tolerances are calculated to give a warning or and error message.
